# CS230-Gaming-Room
Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

  The client, The Gaming Room, wants to develop a web-based game that serves multiple platforms based on their current game, Draw It or Lose It, which is currently available on an Android app only. Draw It or Lose It is loosely similar to the 1980s television game Win, Lose or Draw, where teams compete to guess what is being drawn. Rather than a player drawing images on an easel to help team members guess the puzzle (a phrase, title, or thing), the application will render images from a large library of stock drawings as clues. A game consists of four rounds of play lasting one minute each. Drawings are rendered at a steady rate and are fully complete at the 30-second mark. If the team does not guess the puzzle before time expires, the remaining teams have an opportunity to offer one guess each to solve the puzzle with a 15-second time limit.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

  One thing I did particularly well in developing this document is organizing the information in a manner that is easy to follow through and understand. Additionally, writing is formal and follows on the previous information allowing for a slow build up to the final evaluations and solutions presented.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

  One thing about the process of working through a design document that I found helpful when developing the code/solution/evaluation was working in steps through the weeks so that each portion of the document gets sufficient attention for producing good quality work instead of having to spend less time on each specific section and focus on delivering results on time. The slow pace allowed for a deeper focus on quality.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

  One part of my work in this document that I would revise would be the evaluation because I feel that although a lot of useful and meaningful information about each of the characteristics, advantages, and weaknesses for each operating platform is presented, I could go into even more detail for the specifications for the client instead of the slightly more generalized tone used in the current version.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

  I interpreted the user's needs based on the requirments presented to me by the client. Additionally, I spent time thinking about the requirments that are indirectly mentioned that would be important for the client even if they did not state it. Consequently, the requirments were addressed and implented into the final evaluation succesfully. It is important to consider the user's needs when designing solutions because it helps reduce the chances of mistakes and/or work wasted in developing the wrong or unescessary solutions.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

  My approach to designing solutions was to work slowly and focusing at the current section for better quality work. Techniques or strategies that I would use in the future to analyze and design a similar solution would be planning ahead and leaving room for changes and working slowly through different parts so that quality is not compromised while trying to meet deadlines of tackling sudden or last minute changes.
